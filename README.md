# School

Four tools to assist my work as a teacher:
-Comment: read my excels spreasheets in maths and french and build commentaries using the info.xlsx.
-Diagnostic: build a list of competencies and students for whom I lack information.
-reports: not done yet. Build a report for one student in particulary. I would like to do radard chart but plotly does not work for some reason.

## Help

The info.xlsx is a configuration file.
